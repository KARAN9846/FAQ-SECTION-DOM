# FAQ Section

This is a simple FAQ section project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with DOM manipulation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section where users can click on questions to reveal or hide the corresponding answers. It utilizes DOM manipulation in JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the answer content.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the FAQ section. Each FAQ item consists of a question and an answer, enclosed within a `content-container` div.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the FAQ section, including the layout, colors, and animations.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the functionality to toggle the visibility of the answer content when a question is clicked. It selects all elements with the class `content-container` and adds an event listener to each one. When clicked, it toggles the `active` class, which changes the height of the answer content and updates the styling of the question.
